== Installation (Development) ==

These are preliminary instructions for how to setup a development
environment. This code is not meant to be used in production yet.

1) Download the app with git

$ git clone git://github.com/e-hulp/HelpIM.git

2) Download dependencies like this:

$ cd HelpIM
$ python bootstrap.py --distribute
$ ./bin/buildout

HelpIM runs on django 1.3 by default, if you want another version (say 1.2.1),
run:

$ ./bin/buildout versions:django=1.2.1

4) Create a database (and a user with full access rights)

5) Copy the development settings template:

$ cp helpim/development.py{.example,}

6) Edit the development settings at helpim/development.py and make DATABASES
   match your DB settings

7) Initialize the DB

$ ./bin/django syncdb

At that point you will be asked to create a first admin user. Remember
those credentials they are essential.

8) Load the standard permissions and other standard data into the DB

$ ./bin/django loaddata setup_data

9) Run the dev server

$ ./bin/django runserver

10) Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/admin and login with
the credentials from above.

== Updating the setup data (Development) ==

With the command:

dump_setup_data.sh > django/helpim/fixtures/setup_data.json

you can update the setup_data to the changes you have made in the
settings stored in the database. These changes can now be imported
by other developers.

Note 1:
When adding models, it might be necessary to update dump_setup_data.sh

Note 2:
There is deliberately chosen to not use 'initial_data.json', to avoid overwriting
data when running syncdb.
