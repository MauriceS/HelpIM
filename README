== Installation (Development) ==

These are preliminary instructions for how to setup a development
environment. This code is not meant to be used in production yet.

1) Download the app with git

$ git clone git://github.com/e-hulp/HelpIM.git

2) Download dependencies like this

$ cd HelpIM
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update 

3) Setup your machine to make django work following the description at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/install/#installing-development-version
(of course you don't have to checkout django anymore as this has been
done in the step before)

4) Create a database (and a user with full access rights)

5) Copy configuration file

$ cd django/helpim
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py

6) Edit configuration file to match your DB settings

7) Initialize the DB

$ python manage.py syncdb

At that point you will be asked to create a first admin user. Remember
those credentials they are essential.

8) Run the dev server

$ python manage.py runserver

9) Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/admin and login with
the credentials from above.
