== Installation (Development) ==

These are preliminary instructions for how to setup a development
environment. This code is not meant to be used in production yet.

1) Download the app with git

$ git clone git://github.com/e-hulp/HelpIM.git

2) Download dependencies like this

$ cd HelpIM
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update 

3)
Option 1 (preferred):
Setup your machine to make django work following the description at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/install/#installing-development-version
(of course you don't have to checkout django anymore as this has been
done in the step before)
Option 2 (expiremental):
If you want to use several versions of django beside each other you can
run manage.py directly from the django/helpim directory. It is modified
to detect the django instance in the vendor/django directory. 

4) Create a database (and a user with full access rights)

5) Copy configuration file

$ cd django/helpim
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py

6) Edit configuration file:
   - Edit the DATABASES to match your DB settings
   - Edit the FIXTURE_DIRS to match your installation directory, should be [install_dir]/django/helpim/fixtures
   - Edit the STATICFILES_DIRS to match your installation directory, should be [install_dir]/django/templates/
   - Edit the TEMPLATE_DIRS to match your installation directory, should be [install_dir]/django/templates

7) Initialize the DB

$ python manage.py syncdb

At that point you will be asked to create a first admin user. Remember
those credentials they are essential.

8) Load the standard permissions and other standard data into the DB

$ python manage.py loaddata setup_data

9) Run the dev server

$ python manage.py runserver

10) Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/admin and login with
the credentials from above.


== Updating the setup data (Development) ==
With the command:

dump_setup_data.sh > django/helpim/fixtures/setup_data.json

you can update the setup_data to the changes you have made in the
settings stored in the database. These changes can now be imported
by other developers.

Note 1:
When adding models, it might be necessary to update dump_setup_data.sh

Note 2:
There is deliberately chosen to not use 'initial_data.json', to avoid overwriting
data when running syncdb.
