== Installation (Development) ==

These are preliminary instructions for how to setup a development
environment. This code is not meant to be used in production yet.

1) Download the app with git

$ git clone git://github.com/e-hulp/HelpIM.git

2) Download dependencies like this

$ cd HelpIM
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update 

3) Create a database (and a user with full access rights)

4) Copy configuration file

$ cd django/helpim
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py

5) Edit configuration file to match your DB settings

6) Initialize the DB

$ python manage.py syncdb

At that point you will be asked to create a first admin user. Remember
those credentials they are essential.

7) Run the dev server

$ python manage.py runserver

8) Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/admin and login with
the credentials from above.
